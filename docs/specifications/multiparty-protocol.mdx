# Multiparty protocol

## Threat model

1. At least `M = 2 * N // 3 + 1` participants are honest, non-compromised and operational.
2. A mainnet (the network which hosts the oracle contract) is reasonably operational, live, and protected from deep reorganizations.
3. Mainnet nodes used by honest participants work correctly.
4. No significant changes of the participant set are performed at once. Only one participant set change may be affected by a mainnet reorganization at the same time.

## Multiparty protocol proposals

Are required to achieve the "implementation secure enough to provide feeds to $1B+ TVL projects" objective.

1. **Deterministic feeds**. Attach to each privileged transaction at least M out of N (v, r, s)-signatures instead of `owner`'s signature.

    - **cons:**
      - only "manual" punishment (expulsion) for dishonest nodes
      - signees have to compute feeds in a deterministic way, even slightest disagreement ruins liveness.
      - dishonest nodes may skip the quoting work by copying other's results
      - up to 3340 * N extra gas cost
      - small changes to the main contract
      - small coordination helper contract for a cheap net
      - small daemon changes

2. Improved #1, **almost deterministic feeds**. In the case when there is a disagreement on the feed data, extra stage is taken to sign the feed data where for each asset the price reported by at least M participants is taken, or the current one, if no such price exists.

    - **cons:**
      - only "manual" punishment (expulsion) for dishonest nodes
      - signees are urged to compute feeds in a deterministic way, but slight disagreements are acceptable.
      - dishonest nodes may skip the quoting work by copying other's results
      - up to `3340 * N` extra gas cost
      - extra stage in a case of a disagreement
      - small changes to the main contract
      - medium-complexity coordination helper contract for a cheap net
      - medium-complexity daemon changes

3. **Non-deterministic feeds, commit-reveal.** The first stage: commit of hashes of feed data. The second stage: feed data reveal. After the second stage, a median is computed for each asset in the cheap net's helper contract. During the third stage, an array of resulting medians is signed by all honest participants.

    - **cons:**
      - only "manual" punishment (expulsion) for dishonest nodes
      - up to `3340 * N` extra gas cost
      - extra 2 stages
      - small changes to the main contract
      - medium-complexity coordination helper contract for a cheap net
      - medium-complexity daemon changes

4. **Non-deterministic feeds, median-in-the-mainnet.** For feed update transactions signees also provide feed data along with signatures. In the main contract a median of the submitted values is computed. Commit-reveal makes no sense here since a byzantine node still can send his data to the main contract.

    - **cons:**
      -  only "manual" punishment (expulsion) for dishonest nodes
      -  dishonest nodes may skip the quoting work by copying other's results
      -  up to `(3340 + calldata) * N` extra gas cost (up to `7000 * N` for 170 assets)
      -  small changes to the main contract
      -  small coordination helper contract for a cheap net
      -  medium-complexity daemon changes

The last stage in the options 1-3 (M+ individual signings) may be replaced with a threshold ECDSA signature generation, eliminating the "up to `3340 * N` extra gas cost" downside, but adding complexity to the daemon. Additionally, any multi-signature participant change requires new group key generation and updating the owner of the main contract.

# Specification

The third option was chosen and further developed. The idea here is to coordinate participants and provide intermediate data storage via a side network (xDai, Fantom Opera, etc). The benefits of using a side network:

- no central point of communication (and hence failure)
- participants are DDoS-protected
- the network can be easily switched (in the case of complete network failure / DoS)
- protocol does not trust the side network

## Participants

The oracle is managed by a set of participating parties designated by an Ethereum-compatible key pair. There is a quorum requirement (a positive number not greater than the number of the participants) to enact an oracle operation.

There may be at least two approaches to cryptographically secure authorize an operation by such a participants committee:

- Transmit a quorum of signatures to the mainnet and verify them on-chain using `ecrecover` in a loop. Implementation of this approach is named the multisignature case in the document below. It's a simple solution but requires an extra approx. `5300 * (quorum - 1)` gas (further optimizations are possible).
- Create an Ethereum-compatible threshold signature and verify it on-chain using `ecrecover`. Signing the mainnet transaction itself is less favorable as changing the fee or the sender (see mainnet transacting schedule) requires re-signing. Implementation of this approach is named the threshold signature case in the document below.

Regardless of the way chosen, most of the protocol stays the same. Differences are highlighted.

## Message hashing & signing

The word "message" below in the phrases like "a hash of a message" or "a signature of a message" means a serialized typed structured data in accordance with EIP-712. `keccak256` of such a message (which must also be used during signing) must be produced according to the standard. The message will be described with a `typeHash`.

`DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` must be computed as follows:

```js
DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = keccak256(
    abi.encode(
        keccak256('EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)'),
        keccak256(bytes("Multidata.Multiparty.Protocol")),
        keccak256(bytes("1")),
        chainid,
        oracleContractAddress
));
```

Where `chainid` is a chain id of the mainnet contract and `oracleContractAddress` is the mainnet contract address.

The phrase "create calldata" below means to create transaction data for a mentioned function signature and arguments.

## Updating the oracle

#### Epoch schedule

Epoch number (== epoch start time) for unix time `t` is `t / EPOCH_DURATION * EPOCH_DURATION`.

An epoch is divided into stages. Stage times below are unitless fractions and must be multiplied by `EPOCH_DURATION` to get the time in seconds since the start of the epoch.

Participant must process an epoch only once.

#### Commit stage

The stage time range is [0, 0.15).

**Participant**

Detect prices for all known assets in any way feasible. If for an asset the price can't be determined, use NO_PRICE (== max uint) as a special value. Create a uint prices array ordered the order of the assets. Compute the hash of the message `Commit(address sender,uint32 epochId,uint256[] prices)` where `sender` is the participant's address. Transact `commit(epochId, hash)` to the contract.

**The contract**

`commit(uint32 epochId,  bytes32 hash)`. Check that `epochId` is current; the participant is valid; the participant has not yet transacted `commit` for the `epochId`. Record `epochId => participant => hash` & emit an event.

#### Reveal stage

The stage time range is [0.15, 0.20). If a quorum of the committed hashes is not present, the epoch is marked as failed (but no explicit storage write is needed), no further actions are needed.

**Participant**

Transact `reveal(epochId,  prices, pricesSignature)` to the contract, where `prices` are the data created during the commit stage for the `epochId`. `pricesSignature` is a signature of the message `Reveal(uint32 epochId,uint256[] prices)`.

*Comment: `pricesSignature` is needed not to trust the side network and not to assume correct functioning of the used side network node.*

**The contract**

`reveal(uint32 epochId, uint256[] prices, Signature pricesSignature)`. Check that `epochId` is current; the participant is valid; the participant has not yet transacted `reveal` for the `epochId`; the previously committed prices hash matches the hash of the `Commit` message constructed from `msg.sender`, `epochId`, `prices`. Emit `epochId` in an event.

*Comment: no need to record all the prices to the state or emit them as they can be read by participants from the tx data.*

#### Computation stage

If a quorum of the revealed price arrays is not present, the epoch is marked as failed (but no explicit storage write is needed), no further actions are needed.

**Participant**

Any participant which successfully revealed during the current epoch does the following.

Read successfully revealed prices from the corresponding transaction data. Take the participant set, quorum, current base prices, and epoch number from the mainnet contract. If the participant is not in the participant set, it stops the current epoch processing. Remove revealed prices reported by the participants not found on the mainnet or with incorrect `pricesSignature`. Remove duplicate submissions by the same participant. Compute the price for each asset: if no quorum is present (too many NO_PRICE or some were removed) then no price update (delta stays the same), the median of the prices otherwise (computed in Solidity uint terms).

*Comment: filtering revealed prices is an extra safety check. Normally, nothing should be removed, see Participant set synchronization.*

*Comment: no need to track and recheck off-chain if a participant successfully committed. I.e. we can trust the contract on this matter. In the worst case an attacker will be able to bypass commit-reveal, but that'll only allow them to copy prices of honest participants.*

Translate resulting prices into full_update_assets, full_update_prices, new_delta_bytes arrays as in [updater.py](https://github.com/multidatacore/validator/blob/7059f26f50f3798059254d28ed3c42d53c63d6a3/python/unitprotocol/fo/updater.py#L63-L111).

Sign the message `Update(uint32 epochId, uint32 previousEpochId, address[] assets, uint256[] basePrices, bytes deltas)` (where `previousEpochId` is the current epoch number, assets are `full_update_assets`, basePrices are `full_update_prices`, deltas are `new_delta_bytes`).

*Comment: `previousEpochId` is needed because deltas are relative, and an update is applicable only to the state for which it was created.*

- Multisignature case: transact `signed(epochId, signature)` to the contract.
- Threshold signature case: perform multiparty signing of the message

**The side network contract**

- Multisignature case: `signed(uint32 epochId, signature)`: emit `epochId, signature` for a valid participant if not emitted yet and `epochId` is current.

#### Update stage

**Participant**

- Multisignature case: gather a quorum of unique valid signatures from the contract for the Update message produced at the previous stage. Use the participant set from the previous stage to check the validity of the signature participants. Transact to the mainnet contract along with the signatures.
- Threshold signature case: Transact the threshold signature produced at the previous stage to the mainnet contract.

**The main network contract**

- Multisignature case: check the set of signatures; check if a quorum is reached. Apply the update.
- Threshold signature case: check that the Update message signature matches the threshold signing address. Apply the update.

### Privileged functions

#### Participant

Create calldata for a privileged transaction, e.g.: `addAsset(asset, currentPrice, salt, deadline)`.

- Multisignature case: sign the message `Vote(bytes calldata)` and transact `vote(calldata, signature)` to the contract. As soon as the quorum of unique valid signatures is present (from the current mainnet contract viewpoint), transact to the mainnet.
- Threshold signature case: when enough participants signaled their acceptance of the proposed operation, perform multiparty signing of the message `Vote(bytes calldata)`.
Note that each particular transaction calldata must include a unique salt to prevent replay attacks. Additionally, a deadline timestamp may be included to limit the TTL of the action proposed.

Also, note that the privileged call signatures gathering requires scanning the entire side network contract lifetime for corresponding events.

#### The side network contract

Multisignature case: `vote(bytes calldata, signature)`: emit an event for a valid participant.
Threshold signature case: a participant signals their acceptance of the proposed operation by transacting `acceptOperation(uint operation_id)`. : The contract emits an event for a unique valid participant.

#### The main network contract

Check the signatures. Check the deadline, if any. Check that the given salt is not used yet; mark the salt as used. Exec the call (via self-call, perhaps).

### Participant set modification & synchronization with side network

Participant set synchronization (between the contracts) is desirable for participants filtering, but not required. Is done as a privileged function (see above), but with extra work performed.

*Comment: the on-chain participant set management code may be shared between the contracts.*

#### Participant

- Multisignature case

Participants produce a privileged function signature(s). Participants don't initiate a new privileged function call on the side network until the current fully signed call is mined on the mainnet. Participants don't bypass the side network contract.

- Threshold signature case

After an acceptance quorum is reached on a side network, the new participants perform distributed key generation (DKG) and announce a new owner's public address. The address is used as an argument of a `changeOwner(address newOwner, uint quorum, address[] calldata newParticipants, uint salt, uint deadline)` privileged call.

#### The main network contract

Privileged calls are processed as usual.

#### The side network contract

The contract verifies signatures using the main network contract address & chain id.

- Multisignature case: detecting participant set modification calls (`addParticipant`, `setQuorum`, etc) via selectors, applying them to self (via self-call, perhaps), and emitting an event when the quorum is present.
- Threshold signature case: the current owner executes the `changeOwner(address newOwner, uint quorum, address[] calldata participants, uint salt, uint deadline)` privileged call, the contract extracts participants.

### Mainnet transacting schedule

Even when all participants are honest, there is the tragedy of the commons (of some degree) regarding paying for mainnet transactions. A simple schedule may be suggested to address the issue.

Let `T` be the time associated with some data, deterministic for all participants (e.g. `epochId` or the timestamp of the block when a quorum for the data was reached). Let `D` be an arbitrary mainnet-related duration, e.g. 1 minute for the Ethereum mainnet.

Then, `i`-th participant must deliver a transaction to the mainnet during the time slot starting at `T + D * (uint(keccak256(epochId)) + i) % totalParticipants` of the length `D`. The absence of such a transaction can be easily proven by looking at the mainnet.

### Extra notes

#### Updating the oracle

- The protocol does not rely on strict participant clock synchronization - in the worst case signed data won't match and multiparty signature won't be produced.
- Moreover, it's desirable to wait for some blocks after a stage beginning to avoid network reorganizations.
- The protocol relies on off-chain computations by the participants and doesn't rely on on-chain computation. Again, no multiparty signature in the worst case. Such an approach has several benefits: small gas footprint (heavy computations are impossible even on side networks), simpler code, no side network state dependence.

#### Participant set synchronization

As an ultimate (and quite cheap) mitigation of the de-synchronization case, a new side network contract deployment may be suggested.

#### Threshold signature participant ban

A temporary automated ban for participants issued late or malformed multiparty signing protocol messages may be introduced. E.g. the schedule may be as follows: two misbehavior per 24h leads to 24h ban. Such a measure is not required to secure the protocol but to facilitate liveness, since a quorum of honest participants can remove misbehaving participant(s) any time. As such, it may be implemented on the side network contract side.
