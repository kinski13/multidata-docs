# Quoting data collection

## Data Collection Architecture proposals in `quoting`

The document outlines architecture for data collection in the `quoting` project. In this framework, `DataCollector` serves as an orchestrator, analogous to the role of `Feeder`, managing the life cycles of various data sources. On the other hand, `DataSourceCollector` acts as an equivalent to `PriceFeed`, designed for each type of data (e.g., trade data using `CEXClient`'s, liquidity data, etc.)

### New components

#### DataCollectionStorage

`DataCollectionStorage` is the layer for data persistence. It provides an abstract way to store time-series data from various data sources. It's designed to be storage-agnostic, initially using Redis as the backend.

**Interface**

The abstract base class `DataCollectionStorage` serves as the interface for all storage implementations. It defines methods to work with time-series data.

For example:

```js
class DataCollectionStorage(ABC):
    
    @abstractmethod
    def store(self, key: str, value: Any, timestamp: int) -> None:
        """Stores a data point associated with a key and timestamp."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def fetch(self, key: str, start_time: int, end_time: int) -> List[Tuple[int, Any]]:
        """Fetches a series of data points based on a key and a time range."""
        pass
```
