# Python development

## Git branching strategy

A variation of the [Gitlab Flow](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-gitlab-flow/) strategy is used.

### Feature branches

Feature branch is a separate branch used to implement a single feature in project. When you start developing a new feature, create feature branch using main as a starting point. If you know before you start that your work depends on another branch, you can also branch from there (and merge into there later). Branch should be named as follows: feature/, for example feature/uniswap-min-liquidity. If a feature is in fact a bug fix, then it can be named as fix/, for example fix/threading-issue. Once the feature is complete, the changes should be merged into main using a pull request.

### Release branches

Release branch is a branch to support of a new production release. When it's time for a new release, create release branch using main as a starting point. Branch should be named as follows: release-., for example release-1.0 or release-2.3. After publishing a release branch, the following things can be added to the branch:

▪️ Bug fixes   
▪️ Minor features, if a new release is not possible (for example, due to the presence of commits not ready for production in the main) If possible, first merge these fixes into main, and then cherry-pick them into the release branch. This approach is known as "upstream first".   

### `rebase` and `force push`

The commands `rebase` or `force push` on any branch should only be performed after obtaining consent from all individuals interacting with that branch (including those who are just reading, for example, during code review).

## Versioning

We version each project in a way that does not contradict the [Semver specification](https://semver.org/).

The version structure consists of three components: major, minor, and patch versions. Each is incremented as follows:

▪️ Major version (0.x.y): At present, the major version is always 0.   
▪️ Minor version (x.MINOR.y): The minor version is incremented when backwards incompatible changes are introduced.   
▪️ Patch version (x.y.PATCH): The patch version is incremented in all other cases, such as when backwards compatible changes are made or bugs are fixed.   

## Dependency Versioning

The management of dependency versions differs between library and non-library projects.

### Non-Library Projects

Non-library projects, such as `validator`, pin exact dependency versions. For example, `requests==2.18.4` would be used instead of `requests>=2.18.4`. This approach ensures stability, reliability, and prevents updates without necessity, guaranteeing reproducibility across all environments.

### Libraries

Libraries, like `quoting`, `validator-shared`, and `commons`, adopt a flexible versioning strategy, such as `requests^2.18.4`, allowing for versions compatible with 2.18.4. This balances flexibility and stability, catering to the needs of both developers and users.

## Style guide

The default rule is to follow the style you see in the project.

### Python docstrings

A variation of the [Sphinx](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html#the-sphinx-docstring-format) format is used. It is based on reStructuredText (reST) recommended by the [PEP 287](https://peps.python.org/pep-0287/) and used by default in JetBrains PyCharm.

Example:

```js
"""
Summary.

:param param1: this is a first param
:param param2: this is a second param
:returns: this is a description of what is returned
:raises keyError: raises an exception
"""
```
Some particularities that we follow:

▪️ Docstring starts with an empty line   
▪️ Empty line after summary block is omitted   
▪️ Description block after summary may be omitted in obvious cases   
▪️ Docstrings can be omitted completely in private methods and functions
